# PKV â€“ Partial Key Verification

PKV is an implementation of the Partial Key Verification pattern for product keys as described by [Brandon Stagg in "Implementing a Partial Serial Number Verification System in Delphi"][pkv].

Contrary to Brandon's example, it offers variable matrixes, which can be chosen at key generation time.

It will come with a command line tool which generates go code to include in your application offering functions to verify the chosen portion and the checksum of the key.
